# Impala Autoscale

This is based on an article by Ryan Jendoubi for load testing Impala with JMeter
https://cloudera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/person/pages/2211938365/How+to+set+up+for+load+testing+with+JMeter

It requires installing JMeter and OpenJDK8 which you may or may not want to do on your local machine.   This will build a docker container with all the fixins to run the load test routine as explained in the above link.
